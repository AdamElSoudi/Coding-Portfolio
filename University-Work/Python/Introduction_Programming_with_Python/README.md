# Electricity Price Analysis (Sweden, 2018â€“2023)

This project analyzes and visualizes electricity price trends in Sweden for apartments and villas (residential customers) between 2018 and 2023. It was developed as part of a university assignment and includes data processing, statistical analysis, and visualizations using Python.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Reads and processes** electricity price data from CSV files.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Plots monthly price trends** for different customer types and pricing agreements.
- ðŸ“‰ **Calculates statistics**: min, max, average, and median values.
- ðŸ”„ **Tracks month-over-month changes** for different pricing agreements (e.g., fixed or variable).
- ðŸ§® **Compares pricing across four regions** (SE1â€“SE4) in Sweden.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `csv` for file handling

## Input Data

- `lghpriser.csv` â€“ Apartment customer prices
- `villapriser.csv` â€“ Villa customer prices

## How It Works

The program guides the user through several steps:
1. Load data from CSV files.
2. Choose customer type, year, pricing model (R, F1, F3), and region (SE1â€“SE4).
3. View a statistical breakdown and visual analysis of pricing data.
4. Explore long-term trends across multiple years.

## Output

- Interactive line and bar charts
- Printed tables with price stats
- Clean, console-based user interaction
