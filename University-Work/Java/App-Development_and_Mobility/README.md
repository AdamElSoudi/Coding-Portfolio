# University Activity Sharing App

This Android application is a project I built as part of my course in **App Development and Mobility**. It is not a real app but a prototype that allows university students to share and view posts related to various campus activities, such as parties, club meetings, sports events, and more.

The app is designed to reflect a digital version of an event board that are commonly found at many universities, where students can post and browse about different activities happening around campus.

## Features:
- **Post Sharing:** Students can upload posts with event details like title, address, time, price, description, and an image.
- **Post List:** Browse a list of university-related activities and events using a `RecyclerView`.
- **Post Details:** View detailed information about each event, including images and full descriptions.
- **Easy Navigation:** Switch between the list of activities and detailed views seamlessly.
- **Automatic Database Creation:** When a post is added, it is automatically stored in the SQLite database, allowing users to try the app and see posts in action right away.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java**
- **XML**
- **SQLite Database**

## How It Works:
1. **Browse Activities:** The main screen shows a list of posts representing various university activities.
2. **View Event Details:** Clicking on a post opens a detailed view, where you can see more about the event and view any associated images.
3. **Post Creation:** Students can upload events with details like event name, time, location, price, description, and an image.
4. **Post Management:** All posts are stored in a local SQLite database that is automatically created when a post is added.
5. **Try It Out:** Once posts are uploaded, they are immediately available for viewing and interacting with on the app, so you can try it out without needing any external setup.

## Disclaimer:
This is **not a real app**, but rather a project I developed for my **App Development and Mobility** course. The app is intended for educational purposes only, demonstrating the implementation of basic Android functionality such as databases, RecyclerViews, and navigation.
