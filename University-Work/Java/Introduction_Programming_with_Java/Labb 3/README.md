# Lab3 - Integer Statistics Program

This Java program prompts the user to enter a specified number of integers and then calculates:  
- The **average value** of the entered numbers.  
- The **count of unique integers** (numbers that appear only once).  
- Input validation ensures only integers are accepted, preventing errors from invalid inputs.  

### Features
- Uses **ArrayLists** for dynamic storage of integers.
- Implements **exception handling** to manage invalid user input.
- Utilizes **nested loops** to determine unique values.

### How It Works
1. The user specifies how many integers they want to enter.
2. The program collects valid integers, rejecting invalid inputs.
3. It calculates and displays:
   - The **average** of the entered numbers.
   - The number of **unique integers** in the input.

**Note:** The program can be improved by optimizing the uniqueness check and enhancing error messages.
