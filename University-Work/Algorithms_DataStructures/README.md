# Algorithms and Data Structures

This folder contains a collection of lab assignments and a project focused on fundamental algorithms and data structures.
The materials cover key topics such as sorting, searching, recursion, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and various data structures
like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and heaps. Each lab is designed to enhance understanding of algorithmic problem-solving
and optimize the implementation of essential data structures, building a strong foundation for more advanced topics in computer science.
