# Miljöboven - ASP.NET Core MVC Application

## Project Overview
This project is a web application developed in **ASP.NET Core MVC** using **Entity Framework** with a **MySQL database**. It was built as part of the .NET development course to demonstrate skills in authentication, authorization, database interaction, and clean code practices.  

**Key Features:**
- User authentication and authorization using **ASP.NET Identity**.
- Role-based access control (Admin, Employee, and User).
- Dynamic data retrieval based on the logged-in user's role.
- Implementation of **MVC architecture** with a clear separation of concerns.
- Database integration using **Entity Framework Core** with **MySQL**.

## Important Note ⚠️
This project **requires a local MySQL database setup** that was originally run using **Docker containers**. Since the database files are not included in this repository, the project **cannot be run directly** without manually setting up the database.
