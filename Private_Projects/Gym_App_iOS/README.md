# Gym App (iOS)

This is a custom-built iOS gym tracking application created entirely for personal use. I wanted a training app that offered exactly the features I needed—without compromise. So instead of trying to adapt to existing apps, I decided to build my own.

## 📱 Purpose

The goal of this project was to design an app that perfectly matches my own gym habits and preferences, with features I personally find essential when tracking workouts and progress.

## 🎨 Design & Branding

Every aspect of the app—from the logo to the user interface—was designed by me. The visual identity is minimal, clean, and optimized for use in the gym.

## 🧰 Built With

- **Swift**
- **UIKit**
- **Xcode**
- **Storyboard interface**
- **Custom model-view-controller (MVC) structure**

## 🏋️‍♂️ Key Features

- Intuitive workout tracking interface
- Ability to customize exercises and sets
- Option to add and manage workout templates
- Real-time updates to workout sessions
- Designed for ease of use during actual training

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is ongoing and evolving. As I continue to train and find new needs, I plan to implement more features and enhancements.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `The Process/`: Contains the source code and development files
- `assets/`: UI mockups, custom icons, and logo (all designed by me)

## 🤝 Usage

Since this app was built specifically for my personal workflow, it's not optimized for public release. However, feel free to explore the code if you're interested in building something similar.
